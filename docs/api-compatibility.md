# KoaLens Backend API Compatibility Update

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to support the frontend's expected API endpoints that were causing 404 errors after the Gemini 2.5 Pro migration.

## Problem

After migrating to Gemini 2.5 Pro, the frontend application was encountering 404 errors when trying to use these endpoints:
- `/api/ai/analyze-image`
- `/api/ai/analyze-text`

This occurred because the backend routes were configured at these paths:
- `/api/analyze/image`
- `/api/analyze/text`

## Solution Implemented

Rather than modifying the frontend, we implemented compatibility endpoints that maintain backward compatibility. This solution:

1. Created a new route module `src/routes/aiRoutes.ts` that handles:
   - `/api/ai/analyze-image` → redirects to the same logic as `/api/analyze/image`
   - `/api/ai/analyze-text` → redirects to the same logic as `/api/analyze/text`

2. Updated `src/routes/index.ts` to register these new routes while keeping the original routes intact.

3. Added documentation and testing tools:
   - Created API endpoint documentation in `docs/api-endpoints.md`
   - Added a test script in `scripts/test-api-endpoints.js`
   - Added an npm script `test:api` to run the API testing

## Benefits

This approach provides several advantages:

- **Zero frontend changes required**: The frontend can continue to use the existing endpoints
- **Backward compatibility**: Both old and new endpoint paths work
- **Clean implementation**: Uses the same underlying service logic
- **Proper logging**: All requests are properly logged for monitoring
- **Documented solution**: Comprehensive documentation for future reference

## Testing

You can test the API compatibility with:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

This script will check both the original endpoints and the new compatibility endpoints to ensure they are working correctly.

## Future Considerations

In the future, the frontend code could be updated to use the canonical `/api/analyze/*` endpoints directly, and these compatibility routes could be deprecated. For now, they provide a seamless transition without requiring immediate frontend changes.
